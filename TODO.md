# TODO LIST:
- SD operations
  - Thread for SD initialization
  - Function for directory creation
  - Circular buffer implementation (desktop c) / testing
  - Thread for SD write (read from buffer /main insert elements in buffer)
  - Move SD related functions to sd.c
- Data acquisition
  - Implement Digital reading
    - Timer interrupt to digital read (push data to buffer and remove logic from main)
    - Implement EXTI to pulse counting
      - Store relative timestamp
  - Implement ADC
    - Group read w/ Timer trigger (same trigger of digital is possible?)
  - Intensive testing with Digital/ADC readings
